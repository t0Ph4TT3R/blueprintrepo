# My HackPad
My HackPad consists of 9 buttons that I will use as shortcuts in the game developing app Godot!

This was my first time ever using KiCad or anything of the sort, so I was able to learn a lot about how PCBs are made!

I used OnShape as my software for cadding the case for the PCB, and I have had prior experience to cadding before this, however, this was my first time importing DXF files into CAD software.

For the coding aspect, I used python because I am familiar with it, however I still needed to google some things about the library and how to use it accordingly.
